# Originals Light -

The Originals Light protocol is a library built on Chromia's relational blockchain that allows the development of decentralized applications without predetermined standards, featuring dynamic attributes and a modular approach.

Dynamic attributes allow the description of real-world assets without the limitations imposed by standards like pure Yours Protocol, ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dynamic On-Chain Metadata**: Keep your metadata intact while leveraging generic operations and queries. Minimal code, maximum possibilities
- **Versatile Token Support**: Accommodate all meaning token types like ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155. Generate your own schema for required metadata.
- **Interoperable Schema**: Use standardized ft4 lib for cross-chain transfers.
- **Mulit-Approach**: Uset what you want. Modular approach or existing operations.

## 🌟 Example

Application example_dapp_dynamic_attribute
Run by command 'chr test' in main directory.

## 🌟 Features proposal

- **Dynamic Atributes as optional module**: is possible to add entity attrbutes as additional module and not require it in regsiter/mint time.
